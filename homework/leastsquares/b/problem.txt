The calculated half-life is ln(2) divided by the linear coefficient of the log plot fit. 
It is 4.04828189712487 days, and the current value is about 3.6 days.
The calculated error is the 1,1 index of the covariance matrix, which is +-0.0171926777257639 days.
Which means the current value is *not* within the uncertainties of our fit!
